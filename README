With Apple's recent decision to stop shipping java as a default, and the current state of the union on Windows, 
you cannot rely on having java inside a browser.  This plugin gives you a simple interface to check for the existence
of java so that you can choose before loading a larger applet.

Why not just use the alternateHtml inside the <applet> tags?  Many webapps these days dynamically build the HTML, and this 
does not give you much control over the presentation of the message.  I wanted a way to programmatically determine whether
an applet can be loaded.
